# CPS803-Final-Project

Group 5 - Jackie He, Rachit Sharma, Siddarth Krishnan

Our Google Colab notebook was downloaded as a Jupyter Notebook file and uploaded to GitHub. To run this notebook with no problems, please upload it onto Google Colab.

The models were built on Google Colab with 25.5 GB RAM and with hardware acceleration (GPUs)  turned on. The GPUs available in Colab include Nvidia K80s, T4s, P4s and P100s but there is no way to choose what type of GPU you can connect to in Colab at any given time. We are using the free version of Google Colab which is accessible to everyone interested in researching deep learning.
